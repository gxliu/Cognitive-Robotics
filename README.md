**What is PDDL**
------------
PDDL = Planning Domain Definition Language
It is a standard encoding language for ‚Äúclassical‚Äù planning tasks. Its foundamental components are:

 - Objects:Things in the world that interest us.  
 - Predicates:Properties of objects that we are interested in; can be true or false. 
 - Initial state: The state of the world that we start in.  Goal
 - Specification:Things that we want to be true. 
 - Actions/Operators:Ways of changing the state of the world





How it works
------------
Planning tasks specified in PDDL are separated into two files:

 1. A domain file for predicates and actions.
 2. A problem file for objects, initial state and goal specification
